FAKE NEWS CLASSIFICATION:
Fake news classification is a branch of machine learning that involves the identification and categorization of fake news stories. Machine learning models are trained to recognize patterns in text, images, and other data that can indicate a story is false or misleading.

The process of fake news classification involves several steps, including data collection, feature extraction, and model training. Data collection involves gathering a large dataset of news stories that have been labeled as fake or real by human annotators. Feature extraction involves analyzing the text of each story to identify key words, phrases, and other patterns that can reveal whether it is fake news or not. Model training involves using machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can classify new news stories as fake or real based on the patterns identified in the training data.

Some common machine learning approaches used for fake news classification include natural language processing, deep learning, and Bayesian analysis. These techniques enable models to analyse large amounts of data and automatically learn to recognize patterns that can indicate whether a story is likely to be fake or not.

Overall, fake news classification is an important application of machine learning that can help identify and combat the spread of false or misleading information online.
